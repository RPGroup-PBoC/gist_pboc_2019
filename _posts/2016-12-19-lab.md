- **Lab \|** 19:00 - 22:00 in College B.416 (Wet Lab) and College B.214 (Optical Tweezer Lab).

## Handouts
Every student will have the opportunity to build an optical tweezer microscope as well as perform wet-lab experiments for the quantification of gene expression. Optional handouts for these materials can be found here:

* [Quantifying Gene Expression: Titrating the *Lac* repressor](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/handouts/laci_titration.pdf)

* PBoC textbook: For the optical tweezer experiment, page 153-154 and the Computational Exploration section on page 207-208 might be useful if you'd like to determine the trap stiffness. [Image Analysis with Rapid and Accurate Two-Dimensional Gaussian Fitting](http://groups.mrl.uiuc.edu/granick/publications/pdf%20files/2009/Image_Analysis_with_2D_Gaussian_Fit_la900393v.pdf) by Anthony and Granick provides an advanced and generally more accurate approach to calculating the trap stiffness.  


## Data Sets
Data sets from both the fluorescence microscopy lab and the optical tweezer labs will be linked below. As these files are large, they will only be available for download through February 28th, 2017. If you wish to download these data sets past this date, please send Griffin an email.

* Monday, January 16th \| [Microscopy data](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/gist_pboc_2017_monday_microscopy.zip) and [optical tweezer](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/gist_pobc_2017_monday_optical_trap.zip)
