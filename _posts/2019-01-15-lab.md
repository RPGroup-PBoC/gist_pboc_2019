- **Lab \|** 19:00 - 22:00 in College B.416 (Wet Lab) and College B.214 (Optical Tweezer Lab).

## Handouts
Every student will have the opportunity to build an optical tweezer microscope as well as perform wet-lab experiments for the quantification of gene expression. Optional handouts for these materials can be found here:

* [Quantifying Gene Expression: Titrating the *Lac* repressor](http://bi1x.caltech.edu/2016/handouts/laci_titration.pdf)

* PBoC textbook: For the optical tweezer experiment, page 153-154 and the Computational Exploration section on page 207-208 might be useful if you'd like to determine the trap stiffness. [Image Analysis with Rapid and Accurate Two-Dimensional Gaussian Fitting](http://groups.mrl.uiuc.edu/granick/publications/pdf%20files/2009/Image_Analysis_with_2D_Gaussian_Fit_la900393v.pdf) by Anthony and Granick provides an advanced and generally more accurate approach to calculating the trap stiffness.
