How can cells manage to perform replication, transcription, and translation with such low error rates!? These papers are very relavent to the lecture today. <br/>

These two articles were mentioned in Rob's wrap-up; about the risks of big data and the need for a solid theoretical footing: [The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete](https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/) by Chris Anderson, which tries to argue that we do not need theory, while [Turing centenary: Life's code script](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/PBoC_GIST_2017/Nature_2012_Brenner.pdf) from Sydney Brenner who takes Rob's view on the need of theory.

## Supplementary reading

The papers provided here are meant to provide an entry point
into the literature for going more deeply into various topics
covered -in class.   These papers have been picked either
because they provide interesting and provocative experimental
measurements of particular biological phenomena or because they
show how to go about constructing theoretical models in the
physical biology spirit described in the course. The papers
that of most direct relevance to what we will cover in class
are linked on the "Syllabus" part of the website.

This paper clearly demonstrates that the process by which mRNA
is produced in the E.coli cell is stochastic in nature. A
surprising observation is that the mRNA distribution is not
Poisson, characterized by bursts in mRNA production. To this
day the source of the stochasticity remains a mystery.

### Evolution

 [Theodsius Dobzhansky (1973), *Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution*, The American Biology Teacher 3, 125-9](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/PBoC_CSHL_2015/files_2015/articles/Dobzhansky_1973.pdf)
This classic article makes a compelling case for the primacy of evolution in the study of biology.
